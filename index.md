This is a long-standing annual event with a broad mathematical outlook across areas of pure and applied mathematics, statistics and OR. It is aimed at bringing together mathematicians at Welsh HEIs, while also welcoming mathematicians from other parts of the UK. <img style="float: right;" src="gregynog.jpg" width="350pt" alt="Gregynog" />

It plays an important role in fostering mathematical discussion and collaboration between staff and postgraduates in Wales, both on research topics and on higher education policy, and offers a stimulating environment for postgraduate researchers to present their results with ample time for follow-up discussion.

The following invited plenary speakers have agreed to give keynote lectures:
- [Professor Reidun Twarock](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/reidun-twarock/), University of York, UK: Mathematical Biology and Mathematical Physics
- [Professor Helen Byrne](https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/helen.byrne), University of Oxford, UK: Mathematical and Computational Models in Biomedical Systems
- [Professor Stephen Gourley](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/people/stephen-gourley), University of Surrey, UK: Theory and Applications of Delay Differential Equations

The main organiser of the Colloquium is [Kristian Evans](https://www.swansea.ac.uk/staff/science/maths/k.evans/) (Swansea University, Department of Mathematics). Some financial support is available for UK-based research students. The Colloquium is supported by an London Mathematical Society (LMS) conference grant.
