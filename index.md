#### This meeting will be held at Gregynog Hall, Newtown on 18-20 May 2020. 


#### Registration is not yet open.


This is a long-standing annual event with a broad mathematical outlook across areas of pure and applied mathematics, statistics and OR. It is aimed at bringing together mathematicians at Welsh HEIs, while also welcoming mathematicians from other parts of the UK. <img style="float: right;" src="gregynog.jpg" width="340pt" alt="Gregynog" />

It plays an important role in fostering mathematical discussion and collaboration between staff and postgraduates in Wales, both on research topics and on higher education policy, and offers a stimulating environment for postgraduate researchers to present their results with ample time for follow-up discussion.

The following invited speakers have agreed to give keynote lectures:
- [Professor Brita Nucinkis](https://pure.royalholloway.ac.uk/portal/en/persons/brita-nucinkis(1256195e-d48e-4e83-bc02-c50d77ab01a9).html), Royal Holloway, University of London, UK
- [Professor Stefan Weigert](https://www.york.ac.uk/maths/staff/stefan-weigert/)


The main organiser of the Colloquium is [Rolf Gohm](https://www.aber.ac.uk/en/maths/staff-profiles/listing/profile/rog/) (Aberystwyth University, Department of Mathematics).
